# Welcome to the Chaotic Code Thesis Cave!

Congratulations! You've stumbled upon the mysterious realm of my thesis code repository. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride through the tangled web of my young and naive coding adventures. It's like watching a toddler attempt to build a LEGO tower - charmingly simple, yet confusingly intricate.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is currently a bustling work in progress, much like a busy kitchen during a cooking show where everything's in a frenzy except there's no Gordon Ramsay to save the day (sorry about that).

**Final Thoughts:**
Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was this codebase. So grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the chaos! Who knows, maybe by the time you're done reading this, I'll have figured out what half of this stuff does.

**Disclaimer #2:** Any mental breakdowns induced by reading this code are not the responsibility of the author (but feel free to send virtual hugs and moral support). These breakdowns are similar to the ones had during my thesis, so consider it a rite of passage into the realm of academia and coding!
